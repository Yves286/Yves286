- 👋 Heyo, I’m @Yves286. I'm just a student who, now nearing the end of my degree, wants to create a portfolio that not only explores what I've learnt but also attempt to fill in the gaps that might have been missed in my studies. These are all passion projects that I hope to be at least functional and semi-polished, but no guarantees.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and cyber security. In future and currently unexplored by me, I would like to look at cyber security in gaming in the form of anti-cheats as well as the psycyhology of gamers who want to cheat. Currently my cyber security knowledge is very broad, I would like to narrow down my interests and specialties.
- 🌱 I’m currently getting a refresher on beginner security analyst techniques. Beyond this portfolio I hope to participate more in CTFs and ethical penetration testing on other platforms like TryHackMe. Additionally I would like to get better used to using external libraries and extensions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any small passion projects that can be run locally.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a fear of spiders.
